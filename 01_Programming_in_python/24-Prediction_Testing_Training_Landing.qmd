The video below elaborates on the ways that we evaluate predictive models. We ideally want our models to perform well on data it isn't trained on. In order to understand that behavior, we can split our data into a training and a test set. These ideas are vital for understanding how well our model works and applying more complicated methods like cross validation.

I highly recommend watching the video using the 'full' Panopto player. There is a 'pop out' button in the bottom right of the video to enter this viewer.
