title: "Analysis of Big Data"
---

Welcome to ST 554 - Analysis of Big Data (with `python`)!

In this course we'll look at common issues, analysis, and software used with big data. We'll discuss the major aspects with the commonly cited '5 V's of Big Data':

Volume, Variety, Velocity, Veracity (Variability), and Value

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "500px", fig.cap = "Five V's of Big Data. Source: https://forum.guvi.in/posts/7148/applying-machine-learning-to-big-datachallenges-and-solutions", fig.alt = "Image displays the five V's of big data in a circle. These are Volume: Huge amount of data, Variety: Different formats of data from various sources, Value: Extract useful data, Velocity: High speed of accumulation of data, Veracity: Inconsistencies and uncertainty in data"}

```

The course covers

-   Programming in `python`
-   Understanding how big data is managed
-   Predictive modeling in `python` and with `Spark` via `pyspark`
-   Handling streaming data

Using `python` as our programming language we'll learn about using Jupyter notebooks to share and document our work. We'll use `pyspark` as our interface to the `Spark` software, which <a href = "https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1lenuvj/how_many_of_you_are_still_using_apache_spark_in/" target = "_blank">is a matrue software and commonly used to handle big data</a>.

## Course Learning Outcomes

At the end of this course students will be able to

-   explain the steps and purpose of `python` programs (CO 1)
-   efficiently read in, combine, and manipulate data in python (CO 2)
-   utilize help and other resources to customize programs (CO 3)
-   write programs using good programming practices (CO 4)
-   explore, manage, and solve common problems with big data (CO 5)

## Weekly To-do List

Generally speaking, each week will have a few videos to watch and readings to do. There are then corresponding homework assignments to complete (see the syllabus on <a href = "https://wolfware.ncsu.edu" target = "_blank">Moodle</a> for homework policies).

-   There will be two exams and the exam windows (days when you can take the exams) are available on the syllabus and course schedule.
-   There will be three projects, the third of which will count as the final for the course. These will require a reasonably substantial time commitment.

## Getting Help!

To obtain course help there are a number of options:

-   Slack - This should be used for any question you feel comfortable asking and having others view. The TA, other students, and I will answer questions on slack. This will be the fastest way to receive a response! (See the <a href = "https://wolfware.ncsu.edu" target = "_blank">Moodle</a> page for how to join the space.)
-   E-mail - If there is a question that you don't feel comfortable asking the whole class you can use e-mail. The TA and I will be checking daily (during the regular work week).
-   Zoom Office Hour Sessions - These sessions can be used to share screens and have multiple users. You can do text chat, voice, and video. They are great for a class like this!
