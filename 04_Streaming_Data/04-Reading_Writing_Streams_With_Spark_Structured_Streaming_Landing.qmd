The video below goes into the syntax of reading and writing streams with `Spark` Structured Streaming. 

I highly recommend watching the video using the 'full' Panopto player. There is a 'pop out' button in the bottom right of the video to enter this viewer.

The notebook used in the video is available <a href = "https://jbpost2.github.io/ST-554-Big-Data-with-Python/04_Streaming_Data/Streaming_Data_Notebook.ipynb" target = "_blank">here</a>. You'll need to download this `.ipynb` file and upload it to your `JupyterHub` environment. Make sure that the kernel used to run the notebook is a `pyspark` kernel!

Remember, if you are off campus you should log in to the VPN and then you can [access our `JupyterHub`](https://jhub.cos.ncsu.edu/).
