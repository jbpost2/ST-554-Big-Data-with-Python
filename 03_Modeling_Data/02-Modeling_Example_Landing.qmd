The video goes through an example of fitting a model and working with a training and test set to help remind of us those big topics.

I highly recommend watching the video using the 'full' Panopto player. There is a 'pop out' button in the bottom right of the video to enter this viewer.

The code used in the video is <a href = "02-Modeling_Example.ipynb" target = "_blank">available in this notebook</a>. You'll need to download this `.ipynb` file and upload it to your `JupyterHub` environment (or run this in colab). You can use a `python` or `pyspark` kernel.

Remember, if you are off campus you should log in to the VPN and then you can [access our `JupyterHub`](https://jhub.cos.ncsu.edu/).
