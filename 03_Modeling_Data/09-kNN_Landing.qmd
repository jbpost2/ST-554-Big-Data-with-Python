The video below looks at the non-parametric model called k Nearest Neighbors (kNN). This isn't a model that we'll be able to implement in spark but is useful to learn about.

I highly recommend watching the video using the 'full' Panopto player. There is a 'pop out' button in the bottom right of the video to enter this viewer.
