At times we are going to want to be able to execute `python` scripts. That is, run all of the code and output something while not being in a `JupyterHub`, `Colab`, or interactive `python` environment.

We'll focus on how to execute scripts from our `JupyterHub`.

## Executing a Script from the Command Line

Consider our `python` script that defined our class from the previous notes (<a href = "student_class.py" target = "download">available here</a>. We can execute this script from the command line pretty easily! If you look at the code you'll see a number of things should print out when we do so.

- First, log in on our `JupyterHub` and upload the file there so you see it locally. 
- Click on File -> New -> Terminal. Or, head to the 'Launcher,' scroll down, and click on "Terminal".
- This should bring up a terminal window at looking at your 'root' directory. That is, it is looking in your main folder by default.
- We can run a `.py` file using `python path_to_file.py`

    - If our file exists there, we can just type

```
python student_class.py
```

    - I have my file in a sub-directory so I can just tell it where to find it. For instance,

```
python 02_Big_Data_Management/student_class.py
```

- If it finds the file, you should see something like:
```
554
Justin Post
jbpost2
('Justin', 'Post')
[3, 10, 40]
[3, 10, 40, 12, 11]
Student(name=Justin Post, unity_id=jbpost2, grades=[3, 10, 40, 12, 11])
```
