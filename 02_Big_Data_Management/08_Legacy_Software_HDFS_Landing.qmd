The video below discusses a legacy big data software called Hadoop along with the common Map-Reduce actions that Hadoop allows one to perform on big data. While not a widely used software at this point, understanding the language and ideas of what made Hadoop popular are important. 

I highly recommend watching the video using the 'full' Panopto player. There is a 'pop out' button in the bottom right of the video to enter this viewer.

## Additional Readings for Week 3

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is often the first step of dealing with data.  However, EDA is somewhat of an art and something that you get better at with experience.  Often people new to EDA don't know what they should be looking for!  Here are some articles that discuss different strategies for EDA.
