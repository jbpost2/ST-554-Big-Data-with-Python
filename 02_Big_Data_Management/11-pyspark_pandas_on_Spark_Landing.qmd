The video below discusses the use of `pyspark` and the `pandas-on-spark` framework. This utilizes a `pandas` style data frame and functionality.

I highly recommend watching the video using the 'full' Panopto player. There is a 'pop out' button in the bottom right of the video to enter this viewer.

The `pyspark` code used in the notes and the example done at the end of the notes is <a href = "pyspark_notebook.ipynb" target = "_blank">available in this notebook</a>. You'll need to download this `.ipynb` file and upload it to your `JupyterHub` environment. Make sure that the kernel used to run the notebook is a `pyspark` kernel!

Remember, if you are off campus you should log in to the VPN and then you can [access our `JupyterHub`](https://jhub.cos.ncsu.edu/).

If you are not an NC State student, you can download docker and gain access to [Spark with a Jupyter notebook interface](https://hub.docker.com/r/jupyter/all-spark-notebook) reasonably quickly!
