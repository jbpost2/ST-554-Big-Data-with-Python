We have a dedicated `JupyterHub` here in the college of sciences! The `JupyterHub` has `pyspark` enabled in it so we don't have to set things up ourselves! 

To connect:

- Connect to the NC State VPN. 

    - You want to download <a href = "https://ncsu.service-now.com/sp?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0018300" target = "_blank">Cisco AnyConnect VPN software</a>.
    - Once installed, you need to login. <a href = "https://ncsu.service-now.com/sp?id=kb_article&sys_id=73c7e352db5844d084129ac5db9619fe" target = "_blank">See this site for info</a>. Basically, you connect to vpn.ncsu.edu and login with your username and password. You also need to do a duo login (I usually use a push notification - type 'push' in as the second password)
    - Once connect, you <a href = "https://jhub.cos.ncsu.edu/" target = "_blank">log into the `JupyterHub` here</a>.
    - Then you can select a pyspark kernel! 

The video below shows a quick walkthrough of this process.
