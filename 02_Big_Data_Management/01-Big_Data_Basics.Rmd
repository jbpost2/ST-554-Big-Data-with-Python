# Where are we?

- Foundation in Python through `JupyterLab`

Now:

- What is Big Data?
- What are common things we'll run into with Big Data?
- What issues are we going to try and tackle?
- What software can be useful?

# What is Big Data?

Useful definition:

- Big data = data that you can't handle 'normally'

<!--too big to fit in memory, data being added constantly, etc.-->

- Big Data usually requires learning of new tools

# What are Common Attributes of Big Data?

- Fifth **V** = [Value](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/big-data-analytics)

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width = "650px"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/fourvs.jpg")
```

# What are We Going to Consider?

- Basics of Big Data storage  
<br><br><br>
<!--storage systems, file types, splitting the data up, backups/fault recovery-->
- Basics of Big Data querying  
<br><br><br>
<!--querying data in a Data Lake, Data Warehouse, and Database-->
- Basics of handling streaming data  
<br><br><br>
<!--Create our own streaming data and do some basic responses to it-->
- Summarizing and modeling Big Data  
<br><br><br>
<!--sampling from big data, mapreduce for counting/basic stuff, sufficient statistics and updating models-->

# Data and Model Pipelines

In the end, we should have a reasonable idea of how data comes in, gets transformed/combined/etc., can be used to build models or predict an outcome!

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "700px", fig.cap = "Image from informatica.com", fig.align = 'center'}

```

# Recap

- Big Data requires learning new tools & considering different algorithms

- Storage and retrieval of data is important

- Modeling and summarizing data can be done

- Should consider overall process/pipeline of data from start to finish
